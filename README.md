# Browser History Twitter Compare
A small university project. The program compares the urls in the browsing history of Chrome to tweets of a specific account.

Due to browsing history being a sensitive topic I've added a EULA switch before the program can be used.

On windows the program should just run by opening the run.cmd. On MacOS or Linux you can open run.sh (I hope, I can't check).
